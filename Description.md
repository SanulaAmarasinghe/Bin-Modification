# Stackable Cardboard Box Corner Design

## Project Overview

The project aims to improve the lifetime of cardboard boxes used in garment storage by introducing a new design for the corners. The primary issue faced by the storage process was the low durability of the boxes due to excessive force exerted on the corners. Our solution is to reinforce the corners with stackable designs, allowing the boxes to withstand more weight and last longer. This approach eliminates the need for cardboard lids for every box, using lids only for the topmost box.

## Problem Statement

Garments are stored in cardboard boxes, stacked one on top of the other. However, the lifetime of these boxes is very low due to the pressure exerted on the corners during stacking. This results in high monthly costs for cardboard boxes.

## Solution

To address this issue, we developed a solution to strengthen the corners of the boxes. The key changes include:

- **Stackable Corners**: We designed two stackable corners for each side of the box, distributing the force exerted on the box evenly across the four corners.
- **Eliminating Lids**: By using stronger corners, the need for cardboard lids on each box is eliminated. Lids are only required for the topmost box in a stack.

## Features

- Reinforced corners to increase box durability
- Stackable design for efficient use of space
- Reduction in the need for cardboard lids, saving costs
- Long-lasting boxes capable of withstanding heavy loads

## Installation

1. Download the necessary CAD files for the stackable corner design.
2. Use a 3D printer or appropriate manufacturing method to create the corner pieces.
3. Attach the stackable corners to the designated sides of the cardboard box.
